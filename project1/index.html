				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Noah Emke. I'm a game developer currently attending college at
					the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I love tinkering with
					just about everything and figuring out how things work as well as
					making things out of the concepts that I learn. I am currently seeking
					a game development or software engineering co-op over the May-August
					2022 summer.

					<h4>A roguelike, wave-based,
						platformer built in C# with MonoGame.</h4>
					<p>
						BankShot was built with a team of myself, Machi Dimps, Michael
						Robinson, and Aidan Vanburger initially as a class project over
						the spring semester of 2021. Over the course of this project, the
						team brainstormed several ideas before landing on this one and
						producing a planned outline of the program. Once we had a loose
						plan down we started building the various systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						The core gameplay loop we ended up with was worked on a bit
						by everyone and consists of starting at the menu screen,
						spawning into a randomly selected wave, fighting 3 waves,
						shopping for upgrades during the break, starting the next
						set of waves, repeat until death and then repeat from
						the menu.
					</p>
					<p>
						Speaking of which, the wave system was built to read a text file
						with a list of wave compositions and then randomly select from
						that list for each wave spawned. These wave compositions are
						similar to the map files but instead of a tile id at every spot,
						its a number representing one of the enemy types: chaser, pacer,
						ranged, and flying types, where they all behave as their name
						would suggest. According to git, this was mostly developed by
						me with misc additions from everyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly, the shop system for upgrades also reads in a file with
						a list of possible upgrades and displays three random selections
						in each shop. Those upgrades that it selects from were built to be
						as flexible as possible, being able to change any stat we could
						think of, any number of them at once, and in either a flat added
						value or a multiplicative one. This was also mostly done by me
						with some foundation by others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Maps were planned to be randomly selected from a folder of tile
						based map files every so many waves but due to time constraints we
						only ended up having one map loaded. The system to randomly select
						them
						is mostly finished so this may be added in the future as I come
						back to this project.
					</p>
					<p>
						To manage and manipulate all of these files, I made an external
						tool to edit and make maps, waves, and upgrades. This tool is made
						with windows forms, unlike the rest of the project, and allows the
						team to easily make changes to several of the games' core systems.
						It was also planned to be able to edit the stats of each enemy
						class and of the base player but due to time constraints, this
						didn't get added along with some other bugfixes that just weren't
						priorities at the time.
					</p>
					<p>
						The source for the project can be found
						<a href="https://github.com/MTFT-Games/BankShot">here on
							GitHub</a>.
						A video demo and downloadable exe may be coming soon.

					<h4>Asteroids like arcade game in JavaScript with PixiJS</h4>
					<p>
						Void Break is an arcade style game based heavily off of Asteroids
						with some
						inspiration from Nova Drift and Bosconian. It's built in
						JavaScript with
						PixiJS for graphics and Howler for sound effects. Originally built
						for a
						class project, the deveopment was time constrained to 2 weeks and
						further
						limited by other classwork. What came out after those 2 weeks is a
						good base
						for hopefully something much bigger as I plan to expand and build
						on this
						as I find myself with time to work on it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game plays very similar to Asteroids in the basic concepts and
						objective
						but varies in several ways. The first of which is the movement
						style, where
						in Asteroids there is no friction whatsoever, here there is a good
						bit of
						friction. This produces a very floaty movement system that is a
						bit more
						comfortable to control while still placing emphasis on the
						movement and
						thinking a step ahead of where the character is.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another deviation is the camera and world. In both Asteroids and
						Nova Drift
						the world is confined to the edges of the view and upon hitting
						the edge,
						the character is warped to the other side. In Void Break, the
						world is
						much larger with the camera staying centered on the player but it
						still
						keeps the ability to wrap around the world seamlessly by using a
						looping
						background and showing the other side of the world over the edges.
					</p>
					<p>
						The health system uses a shield and health bar instead of lives
						and the
						shield starts to replenish after several seconds of not taking
						damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						The asteroids are spawned with a size and frequency dependant on
						the
						current score and the number of asteroids already in existence.
						The
						shape is randomly generated for each asteroid and velocity as well
						as initial placement are random. Upon breaking an asteroid, it
						will
						fragment into others if it is large enough and increment the
						score.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since it a web game made in JavaScript, you can try it out right
						here
						in your browser!
