    <h1>Hay, looks like you came here a little early.</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>
		Hi, I'm Noah Emke. I'm a game developer currently attending college at the Rochester Institute of
		Technology (RIT). I love tinkering with just about everything and figuring out how things work, as
		well as making things out of the concepts that I learn. I am currently seeking a game development or
		software engineering co-op over the May-August 2022 summer.

    <h2>Wheres the site?</h2>
    <p>
        I haven't finished my portfolio site yet but if you'd like to see what I have so far you can go ahead and take a look around. Just keep in mind that this  <strong>not finished and is a work in progress.</strong>
        <a href="project1/">Here</a> is the page as it currently is and if you'd like to follow my progress or dig in to the source can check out the GitHub repo at: <a href="https://github.com/MTFT-Games/personal-website">github.com/MTFT-Games/personal-website</a>
