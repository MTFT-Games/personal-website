				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Noah Emke. I'm a game developer and programmer finishing
					up my senior year at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
					I love tinkering with just about everything and figuring out how
					things work. I also enjoy making projects out of the concepts
					that I learn in my free time. I am currently seeking a full time
					position in game development or software engineering upon
					graduating in may this year.

					<h4>
						A custom arcade cabinet built for developers, by developers.
					</h4>
					<p>
						Devcade is an entirely custom arcade system platform in Computer 
						Science House(CSH) at RIT, started and led by me and worked on
						by several members of the organization. The project is built 
						entirely from scratch with a custom cabinet design, custom 
						menu and launcher, custom website, and custom api. All of 
						these work together to play custom games made by 
						the community.
					</p>
					<p>
						At this point over 20 of these games have been made for the project. 
						They range from small and simple casual games, to recreations 
						of classics, and even some larger games with significant 
						development time. Most of them are made by a mix of people 
						already otherwise involved in the project and others within 
						the organization but a handful have been a result of a 
						university wide game jam we organized.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's been shown off at multiple exhibitions, the first of which 
						was Rochester Makerfaire 2022. At that point we had just barely 
						put together the cabinet and painted it but since then it has 
						been brought to Imagine RIT 2023, Rochester Makerfaire 2023, 
						and soon Imagine RIT 2024. Additionally it has been shown at 
						several smaller club events within RIT and we are working on
						building a second cabinet in one of the academic buildings on
						campus.
					</p>
					<p>
						The project has been open source from the beginning with everything 
						being public under the 
						<a href="https://github.com/topics/devcade?q=org%3AComputerScienceHouse">
							Computer Science House GitHub</a> and more information available on
						the <a href="https://devcade.csh.rit.edu">project website</a>.

					<h4>
						A roguelike, wave-based, platformer built in C# with
						MonoGame.
					</h4>
					<p>
						BankShot was built with a team of myself, Machi Dimps,
						Michael Robinson, and Aidan Vanburger initially as a class
						project over the spring semester of 2021. Over the course of
						this project, the team brainstormed several ideas before
						landing on this one and producing a planned outline of the
						program. Once we had a loose plan down we started building
						the various systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						The core gameplay loop we ended up with was worked on a bit
						by everyone and consists of starting at the menu screen,
						spawning into a randomly selected wave, fighting 3 waves,
						shopping for upgrades during the break, starting the next
						set of waves, repeat until death and then repeat from
						the menu.
					</p>
					<p>
						Speaking of which, the wave system was built to read a text
						file with a list of wave compositions and then randomly
						select from that list for each wave spawned. These wave
						compositions are similar to the map files but instead of a
						tile id at every spot, its a number representing one of the
						enemy types: chaser, pacer, ranged, and flying types, where
						they all behave as their name would suggest. According to
						git, this was mostly developed by me with misc additions from
						everyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly, the shop system for upgrades also reads in a file
						with a list of possible upgrades and displays three random
						selections in each shop. Those upgrades that it selects from
						were built to be as flexible as possible, being able to
						change any stat we could think of, any number of them at
						once, and in either a flat added value or a multiplicative
						one. This was also mostly done by me with some foundation by
						others.
					</p>
					<p>
						Maps were planned to be randomly selected from a folder of
						tile based map files every so many waves but due to time
						constraints we only ended up having one map loaded. The
						system to randomly select them is mostly finished so this may
						be added in the future as I come back to this project.
					</p>
					<p>
						To manage and manipulate all of these files, I made an
						external tool to edit and make maps, waves, and upgrades.
						This tool is made with windows forms, unlike the rest of the
						project, and allows the team to easily make changes to
						several of the games' core systems. It was also planned to be
						able to edit the stats of each enemy class and of the base
						player but due to time constraints, this didn't get added
						along with some other bugfixes that just weren't priorities
						at the time.
					</p>
					<p>
						The source for the project can be found
						<a href="https://github.com/MTFT-Games/BankShot">
							here on GitHub
						</a>.
						A video demo and downloadable exe may be coming soon.

					<h4>Asteroids like arcade game in JavaScript with PixiJS</h4>
					<p>
						Void Break is an arcade style game based heavily off of
						Asteroids with some inspiration from Nova Drift and
						Bosconian. It's built in JavaScript with PixiJS for graphics
						and Howler for sound effects. Originally built for a class
						project, the deveopment was time constrained to 2 weeks and
						further limited by other classwork. What came out after those
						2 weeks is a good base for hopefully something much bigger as
						I plan to expand and build on this as I find myself with time
						to work on it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game plays very similar to Asteroids in the basic
						concepts and objective but varies in several ways. The first
						of which is the movement style, where in Asteroids there is
						no friction whatsoever, here there is a good bit of friction.
						This produces a very floaty movement system that is a bit
						more comfortable to control while still placing emphasis on
						the movement and thinking a step ahead of where the character
						is.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another deviation is the camera and world. In both Asteroids
						and Nova Drift the world is confined to the edges of the view
						and upon hitting the edge, the character is warped to the
						other side. In Void Break, the world is much larger with the
						camera staying centered on the player but it still keeps the
						ability to wrap around the world seamlessly by using a
						looping background and showing the other side of the world
						over the edges.
					</p>
					<p>
						The health system uses a shield and health bar instead of
						lives and the shield starts to replenish after several
						seconds of not taking damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						The asteroids are spawned with a size and frequency dependant
						on the current score and the number of asteroids already in
						existence. The shape is randomly generated for each asteroid
						and velocity as well as initial placement are random. Upon
						breaking an asteroid, it will fragment into others if it is
						large enough and increment the score.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since it a web game made in JavaScript, you can try it out
						right here in your browser!
