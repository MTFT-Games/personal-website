    <ul>
        <li>Functional<ul>
                <li>Uses the ClickUp API</li>
                <li>Stores view settings and last loaded tasks source in local
                    storage</li>
                <li>For controls it has: <ul>
                        <li>The entire expandable hierarchy on the left with buttons
                            on each workspace, space, folder, and list to expand them
                            or shoe the tasks in that section</li>
                        <li>The sort setting</li>
                        <li>The group setting</li>
                        <li>The subtask setting</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>No javascript errors are thrown by the app to my knowledge unless
                    you count when I make a custom popup for something going wrong
                    that doesnt throw an exception.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>design and interaction<ul>
                <li>i think decent interface inspired by the clickup app</li>
                <li>does not resemble GIPHY</li>
                <li>controls are labeled </li>
                <li>instructions are provided on first use.</li>
                <li>errors are handled with a custom popup message</li>
                <li>the state of the app is shown with a loading gif whenever the app
                    is loading or waiting on an api request</li>
                <li>It should be usable at various sizes but the responsiveness needs
                    improvement</li>
                <li>html and css is valid and images are almost all svg</li>
                <li>all js is external using only let and const and queryselector
                </li>
                <li>dry is mostly followed although some improvements could likely be
                    made</li>
                <li>All functions have JSDoc comments and inline comments within. i
                    think i did pretty good on the comments.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think this is A- or B+. Especially when it is noted that i went above and
        beyond and set up a cors-anywhere proxy on my own server as well as just the
        amount of javascript that went into this app. I dont have much of a reference
        but 1000+ lines of javascript seems like a lot...</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What are you planning to create? Include purpose, audience, and main
            functionality.<ul>
                <li>A window into my to-do lists. Friends can see how busy I am
                    before dragging me into a game or parents can see how I&#39;m
                    keeping up with things, others can for any other reason see what
                    I&#39;m currently working on and what I have to do, potential
                    employers might look into the progress or plans for work in
                    progress projects.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What API(s) are you planning to use? If it&#39;s not one of the
            pre-selected APIs, include a link to the documentation for it.
            If you are hoping to use a &quot;choose your own&quot; API, you must also
            include a link to a page on banjo where results from the API are visible
            on a web page - no formatting necessary.<ul>
                <li>API: Clickup<ul>
                        <li>What is that?: A project/task management app <a
                                href="https://clickup.com/">https://clickup.com/</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>Test on banjo: <a
                        href="https://people.rit.edu/nre5152/235/project2/test.html">https://people.rit.edu/nre5152/235/project2/test.html</a>
                </li>
                <li>Can I access it?: yes see above</li>
                <li>Does it support CORS?: kinda no but i set up a proxy with a
                    cors-anywhere nodejs server running on my server and configured
                    the apache server hosting my website to send requests through to
                    it when appropriate. it was kinda easy, I thought you said that
                    would be a pain in the vid.<ul>
                        <li>TLDR: No but i fixed it so it works anyway.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Does it require Oauth?: No, it can use a personal token or Oauth.
                </li>
                <li>Does it have a free tier?: Yes, free ClickUp accounts get 100
                    requests per minute which I think is plenty for this usage.</li>
            </ul>
