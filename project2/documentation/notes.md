# Pitch
- What are you planning to create?  Include purpose, audience, and main functionality.
  - A window into my to-do lists. Friends can see how busy I am before dragging me into a game or parents can see how I'm keeping up with things, others can for any other reason see what I'm currently working on and what I have to do, potential employers might look into the progress or plans for work in progress projects.
- What API(s) are you planning to use?  If it's not one of the pre-selected APIs, include a link to the documentation for it.
If you are hoping to use a "choose your own" API, you must also include a link to a page on banjo where results from the API are visible on a web page - no formatting necessary.
  - API: Clickup
    - What is that?: A project/task management app https://clickup.com/
  - Documentation: https://clickup.com/api
  - Test on banjo: https://people.rit.edu/nre5152/235/project2/test.html
  - Can I access it?: yes see above
  - Does it support CORS?: kinda no but i set up a proxy with a cors-anywhere nodejs server running on my server and configured the apache server hosting my website to send requests through to it when appropriate. it was kinda easy, I thought you said that would be a pain in the vid.
    - TLDR: No but i fixed it so it works anyway.
  - Does it require Oauth?: No, it can use a personal token or Oauth. 
  - Does it have a free tier?: Yes, free ClickUp accounts get 100 requests per minute which I think is plenty for this usage.
